To install FreeFem go to FreeFem website: https://freefem.org
On the Download area you can download the must current version of FreeFem
Since the compilation might not be easy, its best advisable to download the binary and please follow the instructions on the website.
From Source code you will be able to get examples. There is a directory that contain the examples.
The documentation also contain installations guide but I don't know how current is the one on the textbook.
